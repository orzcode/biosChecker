To have koyeb run the scripts:

Trigger route already setup in express
Secret Env Vars already set in app and both platforms
GH YML schedule has been commented out - can run manually or un-comment

Koyeb build: Dockerfile may work with current file, but short on mem for PW
There was also an issue with a build error right at the end of Koyeb, but it didn't seem to affect anything
