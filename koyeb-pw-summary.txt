To have koyeb run the scripts:

Trigger route already setup in express (commented else koyeb autoruns - see below)
Secret Env Vars already set in app and both platforms
GH YML schedule has been commented out - can run manually or un-comment
moboFetcher.js and runTasks.js had their autorun commented out (trigger route calls them)
i.e - have them autorun themselves if on GH, otherwise comment this out

Koyeb build: Dockerfile may work with current file, but short on mem for PW
There was also an issue with a build error right at the end of Koyeb, but it didn't seem to affect anything
