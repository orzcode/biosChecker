# ASRock Bios Update Checker

A simple tool that alerts you via email to recent BIOS updates for your ASRock motherboard. Only supports the two most recent generations from AMD and Intel: AM4, AM5, and LGA1700, LGA1851.

This is a personal project created with Node and Express.js, hosted via Koyeb along with the SQL database, and Resend for the mail solution. New motherboards (if any) are added on a weekly basis and updates & subsequent email notifications are performed daily.

**This project is not affiliated with ASRock in any way.** Please note that this is an unofficial tool and not supported by ASRock. As with any such service, things can break, fail to update, URLs can change, or the service may be abandoned at any time. Long-term reliability is not guaranteed.
