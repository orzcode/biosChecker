# ASRock Bios Update Checker & Notifier

A simple tool that alerts you via email about new BIOS updates for your ASRock motherboard. Supports the two most recent generations of socket from AMD and Intel: AM4 & AM5 for AMD, and LGA1700 & LGA1851 for Intel.

The site can be viewed at https://www.asrockbioschecker.link

This is a personal project created with Node and Express.js, deployed via Vercel with SQL databasing via Neon, and Resend for the mail solution. New motherboards (if any) are added on a weekly basis and bios update checks/notifications are performed daily if needed.

The tool is free to use, originally intended just for myself, until I decided to spend more time working on it so that everyone could use it. If you do find it useful you are welcome to make a small contribution to support its creation and costs involved with hosting:
